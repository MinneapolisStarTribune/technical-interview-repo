## Instructions
Below is a sample ticket you might receive at the Minnesota Star Tribune, written by a product manager or scrum master.

Your task is to read through it, understand the intent, and implement a solution. This is your opportunity to show us how you approach a problem, organize your code, and communicate trade-offs or ideas. If you see opportunities to improve the existing code, feel free to go for it ‚Äî or leave a comment noting what you'd change and why.

‚è±Ô∏è **Time Expectations**  
Please aim to spend around **1 hour** on this. No more than **2 hours max** ‚Äî we want to respect your time.

üí¨ **Stuck or Blocked?**  
It happens!

If you run into any snags ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs the repo not setting up, you‚Äôre confused about the project structure, or something just isn‚Äôt clicking ‚Äî please reach out to the hiring manager. Asking for help is a skill we value deeply here, and we see debugging and pair-programming as collaborative, not corrective.

If you need a hand, we‚Äôll hop on a quick call and work through it together. This isn‚Äôt a test of perfection ‚Äî it‚Äôs a chance to get a feel for how we solve problems together.

üì¶ **Submitting Your Work**  
When you‚Äôre done, push your changes to GitHub and create a draft Pull Request. During the technical portion of your final interview, you‚Äôll sit down with a team member to walk through your solution and discuss your approach, trade-offs, and ideas.

### ‚ú® Feature: Author Profile Pages

**Problem Statement**
Right now, our app shows a list of articles, but there's no way to explore more about the authors behind the work. Readers can see a byline, but they can‚Äôt learn who the author is or what else they‚Äôve written.

**Proposed Solution**
We recently introduced a dedicated dataset of authors (`apps/web/src/hardcoded-data/authors.tsx`). Let‚Äôs use this to power a brand new author profile page. Clicking an author‚Äôs name will take the user to `/author/author-name`, where they can learn more about that journalist.

**Business Value**
Author pages help personalize the reading experience and strengthen trust. They create a clearer sense of voice and expertise while also encouraging deeper engagement with related content. This improves reader retention and lays the groundwork for future features like "follow this author" or "trending journalists."

**Business Requirements**
 - All author names should be clickable.
 - Clicking on a name should navigate to `/author/author-name`.
    - The author page must include:
        - Author‚Äôs full name
        - Their bio
        - A headshot image

**Design Comps**

It‚Äôs expected that your implementation will not match the design exactly.

### ‚ùì Open Question
We‚Äôd **LOVE** to include previews of that author‚Äôs articles on their profile page. Is that something you think is feasible given how the data is currently set up?
It's alright if it‚Äôs out of scope ‚Äî but if it‚Äôs a relatively straightforward addition, we‚Äôd love to see it explored!
